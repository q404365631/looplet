"""Persistent memory sources for agent loops.

Many agent frameworks inject a project-level memory file into every
prompt, surviving all compactions. This module gives looplet an
equivalent that is *domain-agnostic*: any object exposing
``load(state) -> str | None`` can be attached to ``LoopConfig`` and the
loop will render it into a stable ``MEMORY`` section at the top of
every prompt.

Two tiny convenience implementations are shipped:

* :class:`StaticMemorySource` — constant text (rubrics, SOPs, style
  notes).
* :class:`CallableMemorySource` — wraps a lambda; receives the current
  ``AgentState`` so memory can vary per turn (e.g. "case id = X,
  pinned entities = [...]").

For a filesystem-backed source, callers can
compose ``CallableMemorySource(lambda _: Path("RUBRIC.md").read_text())``
— looplet core stays out of the filesystem.

Rendering is done by :func:`render_memory`, which returns a single
string joined by blank lines with empty/None returns skipped.
